# AppletHub Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the AppletHub architecture.

## Key Components

*Note: Diagram is a conceptual representation*

AppletHub is built around several key components that work together to provide a modular, extensible platform:

### Module System

The Module System is the core of AppletHub. It handles:

- Module discovery and loading
- Dependency resolution
- Module lifecycle management
- Capability verification

The Module System ensures that modules are loaded in the correct order, with their dependencies satisfied, and that they have the capabilities they need to function.

### TupleStore

The TupleStore provides a hierarchical key-value store that serves as the central data repository. It features:

- Path-based access to data
- Reactive updates via subscriptions
- Transaction support
- Data import/export

Modules use the TupleStore to store and share state, with each module having its own namespace.

### Service Registry

The Service Registry enables modules to expose and consume services. It provides:

- Service registration and discovery
- Version management
- Service lifecycle tracking

Services are the primary way that modules communicate with each other, allowing them to expose APIs for other modules to use.

### UI System

The UI System provides a component-based approach to building user interfaces. Key features include:

- Slot-based composition
- Component registration and rendering
- Theme management
- View lifecycle management

Modules can register UI components to be rendered in specific slots, allowing for a composable UI that adapts to the modules that are loaded.

### Client SDK

The Client SDK provides a unified interface for applications to interact with AppletHub. It includes:

- Connection management
- Module loading
- RPC communication
- Event handling

Applications use the Client SDK to connect to AppletHub, load modules, and interact with the platform.

## Data Flow

Data flows through AppletHub in the following ways:

1. **Module Loading**: The Module System discovers and loads modules, resolving dependencies and verifying capabilities.
2. **Service Registration**: Modules register services with the Service Registry during initialization.
3. **UI Registration**: Modules register UI components with the UI System.
4. **Data Storage**: Modules store and retrieve data from the TupleStore.
5. **Reactive Updates**: When data changes in the TupleStore, subscribed modules are notified.
6. **Service Invocation**: Modules invoke services from other modules through the Service Registry.
7. **UI Rendering**: The UI System renders components in their designated slots.

## Extension Points

AppletHub is designed to be extensible. The primary extension points are:

- **Modules**: Create new modules to add functionality to the platform.
- **Services**: Define and implement services to expose APIs to other modules.
- **UI Components**: Create UI components that can be rendered in slots.
- **TupleStore Decorators**: Add new capabilities to the TupleStore.
- **Module Loaders**: Implement custom module loading strategies.

## Security Model

AppletHub employs a capability-based security model:

- Modules declare the capabilities they provide and require.
- The Module System verifies that all required capabilities are satisfied.
- Modules only have access to the services and data they are granted.
- The TupleStore can restrict access to specific paths.

## Deployment Models

AppletHub supports various deployment models:

- **Standalone**: Run AppletHub as a standalone application.
- **Embedded**: Embed AppletHub in an existing application.
- **Client-Server**: Run AppletHub on a server with clients connecting remotely.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Connect multiple AppletHub instances in a peer-to-peer network.

## Module Lifecycle

Modules go through the following lifecycle:

1. **Discovery**: The Module System discovers available modules.
2. **Resolution**: Dependencies are resolved, and a load order is determined.
3. **Loading**: Modules are loaded in the determined order.
4. **Initialization**: Each module's `initialize` function is called.
5. **Running**: Modules are active and can interact with the system.
6. **Stopping**: Modules can be stopped, triggering their `cleanup` function.
7. **Unloading**: Modules are unloaded from the system.

## Performance Considerations

AppletHub is designed with performance in mind:

- **Lazy Loading**: Modules are loaded only when needed.
- **Efficient Data Access**: The TupleStore provides efficient access to nested data.
- **Minimal Re-rendering**: UI components are re-rendered only when their data changes.
- **Optimized Dependencies**: The Module System optimizes dependency resolution to minimize loads.
